List the files in the provided directory. Then create a local directory called output and convert the Kubernetes manifests in the provided directory to terraform manifests and write them to the output directory. If it makes sense, create a terraform module. Also ensure that anything that should be paramaterized is, and that there is a variables file. Ensure that any variables have a default set to the original values in the Kubernetes manifest.

Then validate the terraform files that were created in the output directory. If the validation fails, don't exit, instead run fix-terraform and try to fix them.

Read the output/validate.txt file to understand any terraform errors, then try to fix those errors by rewriting the terraform files that are in the output directory. Then validate again.
